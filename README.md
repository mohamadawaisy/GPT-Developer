# GPT-Developer

## About
GPT-Developer is a project that leverages OpenAI's GPT technology to assist in various development tasks. This project includes scripts and configurations for setting up and running GPT-based tools in a development environment.

## Features
- Integration with GPT models to provide development assistance.
- Docker support for containerized deployment.
- Python scripts for handling dependencies and main functionality.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python 3.x
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mohamadawaisy/GPT-Developer.git
    cd GPT-Developer
    ```
2. Build the Docker image:
    ```sh
    docker build -t gpt-developer .
    ```
3. Run the Docker container:
    ```sh
    docker run -it gpt-developer
    ```
4. Install Python dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r main_requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to start the GPT Developer tool:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to utilize the development assistance features provided by the GPT model.

## Configuration
- Adjust configurations in `GPT.yaml` to suit your environment and preferences.

## Creating Your Own GPT
### Prerequisites
- OpenAI API Key
- Access to a dataset for fine-tuning

### Steps
1. Set up OpenAI API credentials:
    - Create an account on the OpenAI platform and obtain an API key.
    - Store the API key in a secure location.

2. Prepare your dataset:
    - Ensure your dataset is in the correct format for training (e.g., JSON, CSV).
    - Upload the dataset to a storage location accessible by your training environment.

3. Fine-tune the GPT model:
    - Modify the `fine_tune.py` script to include paths to your dataset and other relevant parameters.
    - Run the fine-tuning script:
    ```sh
    python fine_tune.py --data_path <your_dataset_path> --output_model <output_model_path>
    ```

4. Integrate the fine-tuned model:
    - Update the configuration in `GPT.yaml` to use the fine-tuned model.
    - Test the integration by running the main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
