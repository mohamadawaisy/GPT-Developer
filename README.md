# GPT-Developer

## About
GPT-Developer is a project that leverages OpenAI's GPT technology to assist in various development tasks. This project includes scripts and configurations for setting up and running GPT-based tools in a development environment. Below is a simple diagram to illustrate the architecture:

### Project Topology
Understanding the architecture of GPT-Developer is crucial to appreciating its capabilities:

- **Custom GPT:** This is the model that interprets commands and requests.
- **Actions Call Backend:** The GPT calls specific actions which interact with the backend.
- **Backend:** Manages code functions, executing tasks as requested by the GPT.

### Capabilities
GPT-Developer offers extensive capabilities, including:

- **Fetching and Updating:** Retrieve and modify code snippets with ease.
- **Refactoring:** Improve and optimize existing code for better performance and readability.
- **Running Code:** Execute code and return results in real-time.
- **Debugging:** Identify and fix issues within the code quickly.
- **Testing:** Perform unit tests and ensure code quality.
- **Continuous Development:** Support ongoing development processes with intelligent automation.

### Interactive Workflow with GPT-Developer
In the realm of software development, efficiency and accuracy are paramount. GPT-Developer enhances these aspects by providing a dynamic interaction model where developers can seamlessly create, modify, and optimize their applications. Below, we detail a comprehensive workflow that demonstrates the capabilities of GPT-Developer in facilitating a full development cycle.

## Features
- Integration with GPT models to provide development assistance.
- Docker support for containerized deployment.
- Python scripts for handling dependencies and main functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python 3.x
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mohamadawaisy/GPT-Developer.git
    cd GPT-Developer
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
2. Build the Docker image:
    ```sh
    docker build -t my_python_sandbox .
    ```
3. Run the Docker container:
    ```sh
    # Running the container is not necessary for this setup.
    ```
4. Install Python dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r main_requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to start the GPT Developer tool:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to utilize the development assistance features provided by the GPT model.

## Configuration
Adjust configurations in `GPT.yaml` to suit your environment and preferences. Ensure you replace `localhost` in the YAML configuration with a public address if needed.

## Creating Your Own GPT

### Steps
1. Define your custom actions and backend services that the GPT will interact with.
2. Update the configuration in `GPT.yaml` to integrate your custom GPT and actions.
3. Test the integration by running the main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## Limitations
Currently, GPT-Developer is optimized for supporting small to medium-sized applications and is focused on Python-based projects. This scope allows for a robust and manageable development environment, ensuring reliable performance and functionality for typical use cases within these parameters.

However, the project is designed with extensibility in mind and can be expanded to support a broader range of applications and programming languages in the future. Contributions to extend its capabilities are welcome and encouraged.
